============

*"Geopunt voor QGIS"*

Goals
-----

geopunt4Qgis - *"Geopunt for QGIS"* is a plugin for the [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) open source desktop GIS. 

The Flemish government Geographical Portal Geopunt offers several web-services that can be used freely by third party's, including other governments and citizens. 

The mapping services are based on the OGC open standard WMS or WMTS and can be added to to QGIS easily. These services can be found through the [metadacenter](https://metadata.geopunt.be/zoekdienst/apps/tabsearch/index.html).

But some services are not standardized because there is no standard. <br/>
These include:

- **Geocoding** based on the Flemish [CRAB](http://www.agiv.be/gis/projecten/?catid=34) address-database
- **Location search** based on databases joined the CRAB database.
- **Traffic obstruction information** from the [GIPOD](http://www.agiv.be/gis/diensten/?artid=1739) public works and manifestation database.

The goal of this project is to make these webservices  also available to QGIS-users.
