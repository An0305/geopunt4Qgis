 <em>"Geopunt voor QGIS"</em></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>geopunt4Qgis - <em>"Geopunt for QGIS"</em> is a plugin for the <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> open source desktop GIS. </p>

<p>The Flemish government Geographical Portal Geopunt offers several web-services that can be used freely by third party's, including other governments and citizens. </p>

<p>The mapping services are based on the OGC open standard WMS or WMTS and can be added to to QGIS easily. These services can be found through the <a href="https://metadata.geopunt.be/zoekdienst/apps/tabsearch/index.html">metadacenter</a>.</p>

<p>But some services are not standardized because there is no standard. <br/>
These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Geocoding</strong> based on the Flemish <a href="http://www.agiv.be/gis/projecten/?catid=34">CRAB</a> address-database</li>
<li><strong>Location search</strong> based on databases joined the CRAB database, like the locations of the schools in Flanders.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic obstruction information</strong> from the <a href="http://www.agiv.be/gis/diensten/?artid=1739">GIPOD</a> public works and manifestation database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this project is to make these webservices available to QGIS-users, so they can be uses for creating print-maps and for doing research and analyses.</p>

<p><strong>General use cases:</strong>
- The services are accessed through a interactive dialog, opened when the user clicks a button or menu entry.
- The dialogs can be used and the data can be displayed at every supported Spatial Reference System, not just Belgian Lambert 1972 (epsg:31370) or wgs84.
- The user can enter a "text" search query and if available also add other search options like a geographical extent.
- The user gets a list of results for the query and he can select "zoom to selection" on this list, in order to evaluate if the selected variable is the wanted data.
- The user can select the correct search result from the dialog and add it to map.</p>

<h2>What is Geopunt ?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.geopunt.be/">Geopunt</a> is the central gateway to government geographic information in Flanders. The portal focuses on a comprehensive data, services and application offerings to a broad and diverse audience. Citizens looking for a suitable land or the GIS-user or engineer who wishes to perform an environmental study. Socially relevant geographic data and services are brought together in an intelligent and user-friendly manner. </p>

<p>All components (metadata catalog , download application, data and network services) are directly integrated. The geoportal is the Flemish node in a European spatial data infrastructure and meets the requirements of the <a href="http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/">European INSPIRE directive</a>.</p>

<p>Geopunt is the website of the partnership for geographic information within the Flemish government, GDI Flanders (GDI = Spatial Data Infrastructures). The Flemish Agency for Geographical Information <a href="http://www.agiv.be/gis/">(AGIV)</a> is responsible for organising and maintaining geopunt.</p>
